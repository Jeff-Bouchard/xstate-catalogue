# Action execution order

Great job!

Assign actions are executed in the order they're passed in, so you can do some clever stuff by combining actions together.

As an experiment, let's try running the `incrementPressCount` twice on each `INCREMENT` to see if they combine together.

It should look like this:

```ts
on: {
  INCREMENT: {
    actions: [
      'incrementPressCount',
      'incrementPressCount',
      assign({
        count: (context) => context.count + 1,
      }),
    ];
  }
}
```
