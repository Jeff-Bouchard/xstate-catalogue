# Assigning multiple fields at once

Good stuff, the machine is looking good.

A new requirement has come in - we want to keep a running tally of how many times the counter has been incremented or decremented.

That means every time we `DECREMENT` or `INCREMENT`, we also want to increment a `pressCount` item in context.

That means we need to:

1. Update the initial context value to contain a `pressCount: 0`.
2. On both the `INCREMENT` and `DECREMENT` events, assign `pressCount` to `context.pressCount + 1`

There are two ways of doing this in the assign function. Either:

```ts
assign({
  count: (context) => context.count - 1,
  pressCount: (context) => context.count + 1,
});
```

Or:

```ts
assign((context) => {
  return {
    count: context.count - 1,
    pressCount: context.count + 1,
  };
});
```
