# Storing values in state

When we think of 'state management', the first thing we think of is storing stuff. It could be:

- The name of the logged-in user
- Data you receive from a fetch request
- The value of a form input

Every machine in XState comes with a value store called `context` which you can assign items to.

This example represents a 'counter'. The machine can receive a `INCREMENT` event, which increments the `count` value in context by 1.

But there's a bug - the `INCREMENT` event isn't making the count go up. Can you fix the bug?
